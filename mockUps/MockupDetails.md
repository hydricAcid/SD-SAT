# Mockup Information

<h2>MockUp 1</h2>
This design has the navigation bar sandwiched between the title and the content. Users can click on a tab to go to that desired section. Users can also explore that section by scrolling down further on the selected tab.

<h2>MockUp 2</h2>
This design lacks a navigation bar but instead uses drop down functions on the smaller headings. Users can click on a heading to drop down and reveal the contents and options. Users can use the scroll wheel to access all options, unlike design 1, where they would need to click on a tab first.

<h2>MockUp 3</h2>
This design is a hybrid of the previous two designs. A navigation bar is located on the side so that users can go to their desired section, but this design also allows users to navigate the entire contents using just their scroll wheel.
